# Minesweeper
I created an adaptation of the game Minesweeper. The board is initially blank and it is your job to decide which tiles to unveil. You can place flags on tiles you believe may have a mine under them to keep track, and when unveiling tiles you will be told which tiles have mines surrounding them to give you insight on which ones not to click. If you are able to unveil all non-mine tiles, you win. 

I implemented the board and functionality using image files to represent various elements such as hidden and revealed tiles, flags, mines, and numbered tiles. I utilized the SFML library (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) to manage the image files and bring them to life. I used an unordered_map to store textures, which allowed me to load and retrieve images. These textures were then applied to sprites using SFMLâ€™s Sprite class, which displays the images in the game window when the code is run. The sprites are updated depending on the state of the game, tiles, and mines.
